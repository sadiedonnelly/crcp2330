The objective of this program is to collect all the circles before the top one slides off the screen. The movement of the topmost circle is related to how often you press the keys. When the circle goes offscreend the screen reads "ERR13" and the game becomes unplayable. Maybe I've taken too many alternative art classes the semester but I think it's interesting to take the frustrating technical aspect of the game and force it upon the user. It really brings to light just how user friendly technology tends to be and the casual user's dependence on everything working smoothly.
